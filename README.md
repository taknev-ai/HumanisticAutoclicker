# HumanisticAutoclicker

## What it is
An autoclicker that isn't perfect. Varies the delay between clicks. Builds on code found here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eamTeszpeZ4

## Uses
Please do not use this to cheat in online games that are CPS dependent. I do not condone cheating in any shape or form. Though the variation in the delay between clicks makes it harder for anti-cheat clients to detect this autoclicker (especially in online games), this script is meant for experimental purposes only. 

## Rationale behind code
Certain values are hard-coded for optimization. As with all things Python, readability was prioritized. Print statements in the script are for debugging purposes only.

## TODO
[ ] Use CSV files for different clicking profiles 
[ ] User defined hotkeys
[ ] GUI (far down the line though, not sure if I'll be able to get to it)

## Known Issues and Bugs
- Does not recognize input if hotkey is pressed within first ~10 seconds of script being initialized
